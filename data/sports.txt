All work and no play, has never been good for students, filled with a youthful zest for life. So, Kings College provides a floodlit Basketball court, a wooden floored Indoor Shuttle court, Volleyball, Tennis and Ball badminton courts, a full size Cricket ground with top end kits, Football and Hockey play areas and a Table tennis room to explore and develop the sporting skills of our students.
