Kings, started as a service-oriented institution, persists on its objectives as ever. With more and more colleges taxing the parents with the burden of capitation and donation, Kings is adulated for being one of the very few colleges that adhere to the very strict policy of "No donation. No capitation". Besides, it offers various scholarships for the downtrodden and underprivileged students to ease their way to excellence in engineering.
